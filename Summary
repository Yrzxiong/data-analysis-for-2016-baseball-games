Summary for this project

It seems that after had finished every pieces of code, all my work is about to understand the target but not the code itself.
Of course, it's really important to understand what the target want. But it does not contribute to my coding skill.
So that's it. I will put this code ahead, and do other staff interesting. Maybe found other ways to finish them one day. Or find other interesting target.

This project is most about groupby function, nothing else. But do this project actually help me thinking like a programer I think.
